# If you would like to specify manual borders, add a new manual_borders section at the bottom of the file.
# The format for each color of border is 'color = ["modid:item1", "modid:item2"]"]'. Replace the color with either a color name (like red or blue), or a RGB / ARGB hex color code like 0xFFFFFF or 0xFF00FFFF.
# Here is a sample you can copy / paste and edit as needed:
#[client.options.manual_borders]
#	red = ["minecraft:torch", "minecraft:stick"]
[client]
	[client.options]
		# If the hotbar should display item borders.
		hotbar = true
		# If item borders should show for common items.
		show_for_common = false
		# If the borders should have square corners.
		square_corners = true
		# If the borders should fully envelop item slots (otherwise they will only show on the bottom portion of the slot).
		full_border = false
		# If the borders draw over items instead of under.
		over_items = false
		# If the borders should have a more prominent glow.
		extra_glow = false
		# If automatic borders (based on item rarity) should be enabled.
		auto_borders = true
